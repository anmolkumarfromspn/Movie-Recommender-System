There is a selectbox on the project page using which user type in any movie name and then select it.
By clicking of the recommend button user gets top 5 similar movies in results.

Recommendations are based on many factors like - Movie titles, Directors, Actors, Movie Descriptions, etc.

Truned every movie into a vector and used cosine simiklarity to find the nearest neighbour -

Used NLTK, TFIDF Vectorizer, and Cosine Similarity to create this model.
I didn't have movie posters in my data so I used a live movie poster fetching API using movie titles.
Used Streamlit to build the frontend.
Stored data and vectorizer using pickle module in python.
